      <h1>Package Purging</h1>
      
      <p>Unlike a normal uninstall, purging a package removes all files associated with a package, even those that might be in use by other packages; as long as a file is used by a package that’s purged, it will get removed. This can lead to Homebrew breaking if you remove the wrong package. Therefore, purging is disabled by default.</p>

<h2 id="enabling-purging">Enabling Purging</h2>

<p>To enable purging, go to <strong>Settings → Package</strong> and check <strong>Enable package purging</strong> under the <strong>Advanced</strong> section.</p>
