<p>Cork is a graphical user interface for Homebrew. Homebrew is a very powerful package manager for macOS, which is something like the App Store. It allows you to install apps and terminal utilities from a centralized location, without having to go to a developer’s website.</p>
<p>You can refer to Homebrew’s <a href="https://brew.sh">website</a> to learn more.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-between-cork-and-homebrew">Relationship Between Cork and Homebrew <a class="heading-anchor-permalink" href="#relationship-between-cork-and-homebrew">#</a></h2>
<p>Cork serves as a graphical user interface for Homebrew.</p>
<p>The biggest disadvantage of Homebrew is that you have to interact with it through the Terminal, instead of it being a standalone app like Messages or Safari.</p>
<p>You can use Cork to work with Homebrew through a more convenient user interface.</p>
<p>In essence, you can use Homebrew without Cork, but you can’t use Cork without Homebrew.</p>

<p>While Cork inherits most terminology from Homebrew, it makes a few changes to be more understandable.</p>
