The Status Page offers a quick overview of the current state of your Homebrew installation and lets you perform maintenance tasks.

## Outdated Package List

Cork checks for updates every time you start it up, as well as periodically in the background. If it finds any updates, it will show you a list of them. You can then expand the list and update only selected packages, or click `Update` to update all of them.

## Package and Tap Overview

In this section, you can see how many packages you have installed, and how many taps added.

## Analytics Status

See if you have Homebrew Analytics enabled or disabled. You can change this setting in `Settings → Homebrew `. 

## Cached Downloads Status

See how much space leftover files from package installations are taking up, and quickly delete them.

## Brew Maintenance

At the bottom of the screen, you can see the `Brew Maintenance…` button, which lets you perform periodical maintenance on your Homebrew installation. See [Maintenance Operations](../../maintenance-operations/main.md) for more info.
